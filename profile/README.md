# An ode to open source.

MocoCast would not be possible without some kick-ass open source out there and its superhero contributors.

So we thought it important to dedicate this space just for this.

Here's the list:

1. AzuraCast
2. Howler.js
3. Swiper.js
4. Flight PHP
5. Animate.css
6. Pace.js

# A few resources.
